                <p>My name is Ahmet. I'm a self-learning programmer and indie game developer living in Turkey.</p>
                <p>I am occupied with developing and publishing my own games, which include some 8bit-16bit style platformers and RPGs.</p>
                <p>I've been actively working on these projects since 2022, learning programming and improving my skills at
                game design, drawing, pixel art, graphic design and sound design.</p><br>
                <p>I work with C languages, mainly C#, but I highly regard the power of C++, especially in game development and desktop applications, 
                the fields I'm most interested in.</p>
                <p>I've had some experience with Unity, but ultimately switched over to MonoGame framework, at least for my own projects.</p>
                <p>I've also been learning and practicing other fields of programming. I have been experimenting with Windows Forms, ASP.NET and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p><br>
                <p>I wrote these pages in VS Code using HTML by myself to share some articles, showcase some of my works, and promote 'Obscure Games Studio' 
                which is a name for my one-man gaming 'studio'.</p><br>
                <p>The site consists of three sections:</p>
                <p>Codlivion, where I may may share articles and guides on programming topics.</p>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/Codlivion">github.com/Codlivion</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@codlivion">youtube.com/@codlivion</a></p>
                <p>Obscure Games Studio, where I will be sharing news on my main game projects.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@obscuregamesstudio">youtube.com/obscuregamesstudio</a></p>
                <p>And Art Workshop, where I would share my drawing and audio samples, as well as some articles on the arts that I'm practicing.</p>
                <p>Please feel free to take a look around!</p>
