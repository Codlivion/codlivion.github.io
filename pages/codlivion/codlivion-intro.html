            <div class="content">
                    <p>I remember that, back in the days, like 2006 or 2007, I would be messing around with text files to write some 
                    html and batch script code to see what they were doing.</p>
                    <p>It's been quite a long time since then. And unfortunately I didn't go any further on learning programming until 2020s.</p>
                    <p>But there was something interesting in programming for me.</p>
                    <p>I was always interested in mathematics. And when it came to logic, I always appreciated concepts and abstraction.</p>
                    <p>Which I think is a key feature in certain fields of programming, like OOP</p><br>
                    <p>I started seriously with programming in 2022, when I was using Unity after trying some game-maker programs.</p>
                    <p>I've done some practice in Unity with C#, and then took some courses and guides to grasp the basics.</p>
                    <p>I've studied and learned, as I improved myself, by facing problems, getting frustrated, struggling and finding some solution.</p><br>
                    <p>Then I decided to go deeper and expand my field range in programming.</p>
                    <p>I've gone through Windows Forms, getting comfortable writing simple desktop apps.</p>
                    <p>After that I started going into web development with ASP.NET which I'm still studying from time to time.</p>
                    <p>I found MonoGame framework when I was looking for a more flexible alternative to Unity, 
                    which got me into studying the core concepts of game programming.</p>
                    <p>And from there I decided to learn about C and C++ as well.</p><br>
                    <p>And this is the brief summary for my first two years of active programming experience.</p>
                    <p>I've come a long way since then. I have a much better grasp on how things work. I still have many things that I'm supposed to improve, 
                    and I may even make silly mistakes, but I'm always ready to learn more and fix my shortcomings.</p><br>
                    <p>I don't really aim to be one of the 'best' programmers out there.</p>
                    <p>My goal as a programmer is to achieve the skills for making programs that serves their purpose and functions as ideally as possible.</p><br>
                    <p>With that said, I have many simple things that I am working on, and I may have some neat tricks that might be useful in some way.
                    so I will be populating this section with such articles, so stay tuned, and happy coding!.</p><br>
