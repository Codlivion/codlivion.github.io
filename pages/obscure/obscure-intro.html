                <p>Obscure Games Studio is a one-man studio for developing old-school video games, where I create assets, design and program all by myself.</p>
                <p>And that is easier said than done since there are a lot of things that go into making a video game, even for games that looks relatively 'simple'.</p>
                <p>There is graphics, including sprites and animations, tilesets, backgrounds, effects and UIs.</p>
                <p>There is audio, for generating soundtracks and sound effects, which is a distinct profession by itself.</p>
                <p>Then there is game design, the concept of the game, its mechanics, level design and possibly many other things depending on the game.</p>
                <p>And of course there is programming, making them all come together as a functioning software.</p>
                <p>So there are a lot of different fields, and I'm not trying to be the best at each one of them.</p>
                <p>It is fine with me so long as my art, design and programming serves their purpose.</p>
                <p>And what I want is to just express my ideas in a way that is interesting or 'fun'.</p><br>
                <p>Video games have always been one of my interests since my childhood.</p>
                <p>Whether it be some mind stimulating concept game, an epic, action platformer game or a story based, long running RPG game, 
                I would often find myself hooked to one.</p>
                <p>They usually were creative pieces of work, presenting new characters, places and experiences to your imagination, 
                and offering certain challenges to keep you mentally occupied.</p>
                <p>And these were the aspects that made video games interesting to me.</p><br>
                <p>For me, the 'golden age of video games' was the era from late 80's to early 2000's.</p>
                <p>I would totally understand if anyone were to argue that it was the early arcade era of 70s and 80s, 
                and it is true that the foundations of gaming was set there, games were simple enough, 
                they had very distinct concepts and they were exactly what you would call a 'video game'.</p>
                <p>But there wasn't much story or lore in them.</p>
                <p>I think that by the 90s, video games still had the originality, while improving in art styles and expressions creatively.</p>
                <p>Playing these games was a unique, virtual experience that animated many things in your imagination.</p><br>
                <p>And that is what I'm about. I aim to create my own such works and present them to anyone interested.</p>
                <p>Casting my ideas, views and imagination into these games in the form of pixels, tunes and text, 
                and making them a fun and interesting experience, both for myself and anyone playing them.</p><br>
                <p>So this is where it begins. I will be updating in here as my projects come together. Stay tuned and have fun.</p><br>
