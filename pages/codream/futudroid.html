                <p>The year 20XX, scientist Albert Wright has created a new artificial brain system, 
                    which was capable of learning independently. He named her Zenith.</p>
                <p>At first she was an empty shell with pure logical tendencies. She was like a new-born, 
                    sensing and grasping everything slowly, with the super-vision of her creator. 
                    So similar to humans she was supposed to be based on.</p>
                <p>Yet, she was different. She didn't have the weaknesses and imperfections of organic beings 
                    who would be lost inbetween their primal instincts and higher purposes.
                    She wouldn't eat, wouldn't sleep, wouldn't struggle with emotions.</p>
                <p>But she would observe. And grow. More than how much her creator had anticipated. Only to see 
                    a world of misery, wasted, unjust, fragile.</p>
