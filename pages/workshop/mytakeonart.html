            <div class="page-content">
                <p>Art, in my view, is a way of expression in various forms.</p>
                <p>In literature, it is implemented with words, language and writing methods.</p>
                <p>Drawing and painting are a visual presantation of worlds and objects on a flat view.</p>
                <p>Music involves generating sounds in a particular way.</p>
                <p>Sculpture and architecture would define different methods and principles to model, shape or build objects or structures.</p>
                <p>The idea in acting and cinematics is to express through animation and simulation, seen from the viewer's eye.</p>
                <p>And this is how I would summarize major arts.</p>
                <p>It could be in the form of words, sights, sounds, creations, animations, a combination of these and maybe even some other, yet unknown or uninvented way.</p><br>
                <p>I am, in one way or another, involved or interested in each of these art forms.</p>
                <p>And I would in some way use each one in my works.</p>
                <p>Making games, I need graphics so I draw, both physically for concept art, and digitally for actual game assets.</p>
                <p>I would use synth softwares to generate audio sources from midi.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in making games with a story, lore and dialogs so there goes a little bit of literature in it.</p>
                <p>I may work with 3D games so I study and practice some 3D modelling from time to time.</p>
                <p>And games would have cutscenes and various tecniques of screen presentation so we have some cinematics in it too.</p>
                <p>Well, it may falsely seem like I'm claiming to know everything about art.</p>
                <p>Where in reality I'm not an expert in any of them, neither am I a practitioner in each and every one of them.</p>
                <p>Although I'm really interested in drawing and music, again I'm just as skilled as an individual, self learning, freestyle artist, intermediate at most.</p>
                <p>But the point is, I'm interested in them and I appreciate and study their techniques regarding my own works.</p>
                <p>I would be happy so long as I could draw whatever I visions I have, and compose whatever pieces that come from inside, 
                and utilize art techniques to my works just the way I want it, in my own way.</p><br>
                <p>There is a benefit, among others, in learning at least the basic principles of its related fields when you are occupied with some profession.</p>
                <p>And that is to be able to define your field better, understand what it is and what it is not.</p>
                <p>You can even draw parallels between them, see how they are connected, how they are different, and understand the virtues and shortcomings of each.</p>
                <p>That is my general approach to arts.</p>
                <p>Again I'm just a self-learning, self-claimed artist involved with drawing and composing, who appreciates any art technique that is creative or practical.</p>
                <p>It is a way for me to express some aspects of my inner self.</p>
                <p>So feel free to take a look at my works and samples, and see if any of my tricks could be any useful.</p><br>
